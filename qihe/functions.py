# Description:
# This script handles the generation of machine-readable files for QIHE PnP machines
# based on the PCB design data provided.
#
# Works:
#  - Windows/Cywin
#  - Linux
#  - MacOS
#

# Create a default mapping file if it does not exist
# or if the FORCEMAPPING flag is set

#
# This file defines mappings for component placement and special instructions.
# Each line follows one of these formats:
#
# Component Mapping Line:
#   1 or 2, Feeder ID, Component Name(s)
#   - '1 or 2' specifies the nozzle number.
#   - 'Feeder ID (:SIZE)' is the feeder location, formatted as Lxx or Bxx. Component 
#      size can be added to feeder L1, B12 or L1:0402, B12:0603.
#   - 'Component Name(s)' are the names of components, separated by colons (:).
#     These names should match the component values in the PCB design.
#   Example: 1, L1, 0n1:100nF:100nf:0.1uF:0.1uf
#
# Exclude Line:
#   E, , Regex Pattern(s)
#   - 'E' indicates this line specifies components to exclude.
#   - 'Regex Pattern(s)' are patterns to match components to be excluded,
#      separated by colons (:).
#   Example: E, , NC:TP
#
# Priority Line:
#   P, , Regex Pattern(s)
#   - 'P' indicates this line specifies priority components.
#   - 'Regex Pattern(s)' are patterns to match priority components,
#      separated by colons (:).
#   Example: P, , FIDUCIAL:TESTPOINT
