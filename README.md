# KiCAD plugin for QIHE PnP machines. "Ki-QIHE"
QIHE PnP Coords Processor for KiCAD
The QIHE PnP Coords Processor is a plugin for KiCAD designed to automate the creation of coordinate files for QIHE pick-and-place machines. This plugin simplifies the process of setting up manufacturing files for your PCB designs, enhancing the efficiency of your production line.

**Features**

- Layer Selection: Choose between top, bottom, or both layers for generating coordinates.
- Component Mapping: Define custom mappings for components to specific feeders and nozzles.
- Prefix Management: Set custom file prefixes for the generated coordinate files.
- Log Verbosity Control: Adjust the level of detail in the plugin's logs to suit your needs.
- Direct Mapping File Editing: Open and edit the component mapping file directly through the plugin interface.

**Installation**

Install via KiCad's Plugin and Content Manager (PCM):

1. In the KiCad main window, open Tools -> Plugin and Content Manager.
2. Either add the repository hosting this plugin, or use "Install from File..." and select the release zip.
3. Apply changes and restart KiCad (or the PCB editor) to load the plugin.

**Usage**

Once installed, the QIHE PnP Coords Processor can be accessed from plugins toolbar in KiCAD.

**Main Interface**
